            <div class="acc_container">
                <button onclick="addText1()">How old should my child be before commencing piano lessons?<img src="images/arrow-down-sign-to-navigate.png" id="arrow1" alt="Arrow down"></button>
            </div>
            <div class="accordDiv1">
                <p class="accordText1">We recommend the best time to start a student with music lessons is when they begin to show interest in learning. 
                    While there is no set age for this, we do recommend that the child is at a level where they can concentrate on a lesson for at least 30 minutes, and have reading and counting skills appropriate to recognise the letters of notes and interpret simple notation. 
                    This is usually around age 5, and we recommend they settle into a term or two of school before adding piano to their commitments.
                    <br> Adults, whether beginner or advanced, can begin whenever they like! The best advice we can give for adult students, no matter their level, is to ensure they have the time to commit to weekly lessons and a regular practice schedule.</p>

            <div class="acc_container">
                <button onclick="addText2()">How long should my piano lessons be?<img src="images/arrow-down-sign-to-navigate.png" id="arrow2" alt="Arrow down"></button>
            </div>
            <div class="accordDiv2">
                <p class="accordText2">For most beginner and intermediate students, we recommend 30–45 minute lessons, as they provide optimum time to consult with the teacher as well as learn new techniques and pieces, without sacrificing the required focus of the student.
                    We find that advanced or exam students may like to increase the length of lessons to 60 minutes to best benefit from their tuition.
                    Adults are recommended to take 45-60 minute lessons.</p>

            <!-- FAQ CONTAINER 3 -->
            <div class="acc_container">
                <button onclick="addText3()">Do I need an instrument?<img src="images/arrow-down-sign-to-navigate.png" id="arrow3" alt="Arrow down"></button>
            </div>
            <div class="accordDiv3">
                <p class="accordText3">Yes! We can't do lessons with you if you don't have an instrument to learn on. Teachers can't bring an instrument to lessons with them.
                    Moreover, most of your development will come from practising in between lessons, and you'll need an easily accessible instrument for that. 
                    We'd go so far as suggesting you'd be wasting your money if you didn't practise in between lesson time.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- FAQ CONTAINER 4 -->
            <div class="acc_container">
                <button onclick="addText4()">What kind of instrument do I need?<img src="images/arrow-down-sign-to-navigate.png" id="arrow4" alt="Arrow down"></button>
            </div>
            <div class="accordDiv4">
                <p class="accordText4">We highly recommend an acoustic piano, but a keyboard with 88 weighted keys will do just fine. We would be more than happy to make recommendations for decisions on where and which type of piano to buy. 
                    For beginners on a budget, we generally recommend the Yamaha P-45 keyboard, which is available at most piano retailers. Renting and buying second hand are also cost–effective options.<br>
                    We don't recommend keyboards without weighted keys, as they feel lighter and quite different to weighted keys and can compromise the proper development of finger technique and dynamics. 
                    If you have a lightweight keyboard, this is ok to start on, but will need upgrading after the first term.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- FAQ CONTAINER 5 -->
            <div class="acc_container">
                <button onclick="addText5()">How often do I need to practise?<img src="images/arrow-down-sign-to-navigate.png" id="arrow5" alt="Arrow down"></button>
            </div>
            <div class="accordDiv5">
                <p class="accordText5">Practice is an integral part of learning to play the piano, and will be the most significant factor in determining your progress. Consistency and quality of practice, rather than time, is most important when considering your practice strategy. 
                    We recommend 10–30 minutes of practice 4–5 times a week for the best results out of your lessons. For kids, parent participation and support is key to the success of the practice sessions.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- FAQ CONTAINER 6 -->
            <div class="acc_container">
                <button onclick="addText6()">How can I get my child to practise?<img src="images/arrow-down-sign-to-navigate.png" id="arrow6" alt="Arrow down"></button>
            </div>
            <div class="accordDiv6">
                <p class="accordText6">The best time for practising is the day after the lesson - which cements the new skills learnt, and the day before the lesson - which allows the revision to be fresh. This makes the most of lesson time, which is for learning new skills, not repeating last week's lesson. 
                    Add in an extra mid-week lesson and you will start to see consistent progress. The best gift you can offer your child is to be involved in and supportive of their piano playing. It's also important that they're rested, fed and free from distractions when practising. 
                    You might like to have a regular performance time where the student can perform for the rest of the family! You'll be surprised how this can positively affect their learning, and how enjoyable it can be for the family as a whole. <br>
                    Another fun idea is to allow the student to decorate or accessorise their instrument so that it feels like a part of them and is inviting for the student to want to play.</p>

            <!-- FAQ CONTAINER 7 -->
            <div class="acc_container">
                <button onclick="addText7()">What's your Cancellation Policy?<img src="images/arrow-down-sign-to-navigate.png" id="arrow7" alt="Arrow down"></button>
            </div>
            <div class="accordDiv7">
                <p class="accordText7">It's best to avoid cancellations, as we don't offer refunds. We'll do our best to find a mutually convenient time for a make-up lesson, teacher's availability allowing. If a suitable time can't be found, then the lesson will be forfeited.
                    In the event that your teacher can't attend a lesson we'll organise a make-up lesson, or offer a hassle-free credit if this isn't possible.
                    We encourage a spirit of goodwill while still respecting and safeguarding our teachers' incomes.</p>

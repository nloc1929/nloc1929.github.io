                    <h3>Beginner Piano Lessons</h3>
                    <p>My piano lessons combine private 1-on-1 with band rehearsals to fast-track my students’ education. 
                        <br>I teach all the fundamentals of music: technique, theory, writing, reading, and combine that training with any song the students wants to learn. 
                        You want to play T. Swift? You got it! How about that favorite video game theme. How about YES! 
                        <br>This method keeps students engaged and inspires them.
                        <br>
                        <span class="highlight_text">Are you an adult beginner?</span>
                        <br>
                        It’s never too late. My greatest adult story is our 70 y/o student who decided to learn the piano. She’s been taking lessons now for 7 years, playing the classics she loves. 
                        At Gold Coast Piano we put adult beginners together in a group class or band. 
                        Adult Program students in the Gold Coast area learn to play piano through weekly piano lessons and or weekly band rehearsals. 
                        Students choose the songs they want to learn.</p>
                    <h3>Intermediate to Advanced Piano Lessons</h3>
                    <p>My piano lessons for kids and adults are designed to help students get results. 
                        As students gain more experience and progress past the beginner stage, they will move up to more advanced bands and a wider curriculum. 
                        This is where students will hit their true potential at the keyboard through private lessons, band rehearsal and live performances.
                        Combining private piano lessons with weekly band rehearsals inspires students to collaborate and keeps them engaged!</p>

                <h2>TESTIMONIALS</h2>
                <img src="images/Testimonial-GIF.gif" alt="Richard is a knowledgeable, energetic and fun teacher who imparts good techniques and at the same time instils a lifelong appreciation of music. 
                He is extremely professional and responsive yet warm in his communication style. 
                I would certainly recommend him to anyone who has always wanted to learn piano but never got around to it like myself. 
                Better late than never. I am looking forward to and enjoying every lesson as my journey in this musical adventure embarks.
                KIM THOMPSON, ADULT PIANO STUDENT.
                6 months ago, we enrolled our 4 year old son into Richard’s piano lessons...
                He was so delighted with the music he was learning that he would draw notes everywhere and would run downstairs to our piano in the morning and play the new music he had learned...
                It's such a joy witnessing my boys learning the art of music in a truly warm, personal, and caring environment.

                        <br>We started over 20 years ago and cracked the code to <span class="highlight_text">making lessons fun and engaging</span> for all ages. 
                        Our curriculum and unique musical games have been crafted to meet the needs of every student. 
                        Our piano teachers have <span class="highlight_text">years of experience</span> teaching music in the Gold Coast area, 
                        and know how to motivate students of any skill level to play piano.

                        <br>Don’t worry, you won’t need to be reminded to practice. <span class="highlight_text">We do all the work for you!</span> 
                        <br>Our goal is to instill confidence in students so they believe in themselves and can take the stage.

                        <br>Our <a href="concerts.html">Gala Concerts</a> are a fantastic opportunity for students to perform for family and friends on a grand piano 
                        in an intimate concert setting, with light show, big screen projection and performances by our students and teachers.
                        The concert is also a fabulous introduction to performance skills, 
                        which build confidence both personally and musically within a supportive environment. 
                        During Term 3, teachers will focus on preparing enrolled students for performance by including a stage 
                        preparation module into their weekly classes.</p>

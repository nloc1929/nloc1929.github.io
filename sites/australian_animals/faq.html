            Modern technology has given us the tools to exploit the earths natural resources as never before. The material benefits have been enormous, but the environmental costs have been high. 
            We have built roads and reservoirs, drained marshes, and bulldozed woodlands. 
            Yet in doing this we are little by little eliminating the diversity and richness of the land and reducing the options for future choice. There are many reasons for conserving wildlife. 
            It is necessary for the maintenance of genetic diversity; plants and animals act as environmental indicators, they provide the natural materials for food and medicine; wildlife is pleasing to all and it provides amenity. 
            All living organisms are interrelated; all crops and domestic animals descend from wildlife and all depend on wild species directly or indirectly. 
            All green plants and all animals (including humans) rely on micro-organisms cycling the chemical elements necessary for life, while many plants also depend on insects and other animals for fertilisation and dispersal. 
            Together all organisms resemble a living body with each part dependent upon others. We do not know what the effect of losing any of these species would be.Children are main users of natural spaces, even very small spaces near their homes. 
            There is a real risk that children lose what they need for mental, physical and social development when places are tidied up by adults. 
            Since children and wildlife often value the same features and details, what damages the interests of one will affect those of the other.

              <li>To provide a <strong>vital habitat for wildlife</strong>. A native hedge plays a part in the survival of butterflies, moths, dormice, hedgehogs, birds, insects and bats.</li>
              <li>Trees and shrubs can be <strong>educational</strong>. Many schools are now developing nature areas which in turn is making the next generation more aware of the environment.</li>
              <li>To <strong>suppress noise pollution</strong>, an ever increasing problem in urban environments.</li>
              <li><strong>Landscape and aesthetic value</strong>, can enhance an otherwise unattractive building or site.</li>
              <li><strong>Timber or fruit production</strong>. This does not have to conflict with conservation issues, with careful management, replacement and natural regeneration more aware of their environment.</li>
              <li>To <strong>stabilise soil</strong> (e.g. hills and riverbanks), where trees have been felled on steep banks, soil erodes and with the absence of trees causes whole banks of soil to wash away. 
                Trees can also protect soil from hot weather, preventing it to dry out too quickly.</li>

            Seeds from neighbouring woods and hedgerows will be dispersed by wind or animals and some of those landing in the grassland will germinate and grow. 
            As a result, the area will firstly become scrub (a mixture of small trees and shrubs) and eventually woodland. 
            This change from grassland to woodland is an example of the natural process called succession. The woodland is the climax vegetation. 
            The field of grass was probably created many years ago by clearing ancient woodland to provide food for livestock and it represents a sub-climax vegetation held in check by grazing. 
            If you look around at grasslands, woodlands, or heathlands today you will be able to see differences in the vegetation and climax structure by the way it has been influenced by man and animal. 
            Every habitat undergoes succession to achieve its climax - woodland, however it is the persistent management that has lead to our familiar habitats.

            As well sites being managed full time by ecologists and conservation officers, volunteers do a majority of the work, either as midweek, or weekend community projects. 
            Volunteers do not need any skills to learn how to save valuable habitats, you will not be expected to work to any target, all practical support is appreciated. 
            Volunteers are members of the general public like you who have an interest in wildlife or have some spare time you want to put to good use. 
            Its a great way of having fun, meeting new people and learning about our wildlife. You can work any time of the week, midweek or at weekends, locally, Nationally or Internationally! 
            Conservation projects can be directly working with animals or plants, or indirectly managing the habitat and improving conditions for its survival.
